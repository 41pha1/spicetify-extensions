# Spicetify Romaji Lyrics
[Spicetify](https://github.com/spicetify/spicetify-cli) extension to convert Japanese lyrics to Romaji. 
* Auto detects Japanese lyrics and translates them to Romaji using the included dictionary
* Support for Furigana and multi view modes planned.

Due to the large included dictionary, only manual Installation seems to work right now. See steps below:

## ‚öôÔ∏è Install
Copy `romaji_lyrics.js` into your [Spicetify](https://github.com/spicetify/spicetify-cli) extensions directory:
| **Platform** | **Path**                                                                               |
|------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Linux**      | `~/.config/spicetify/Extensions` or `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/.config/spicetify/Extensions/` |
| **MacOS**      | `~/.config/spicetify/Extensions` or `$SPICETIFY_CONFIG/Extensions`                   |
| **Windows**    | `%appdata%/spicetify/Extensions/`                                               |

After putting the extension file into the correct folder, run the following command to install the extension:
```
